# Deprecation Notice

**This repository is no longer actively maintained or updated.** We encourage developers to utilize the official Telnyx [OpenAPI Specifications](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/overview) alongside modern mocking tools. By doing so, you can quickly spin up a pseudo mock server for prototyping or testing without relying on this deprecated project.

## Recommended Alternatives

Below are some popular OpenAPI-based mocking tools that can help you replicate a mock server workflow:

1. **[Stoplight’s Prism](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism)**
   - Prism can mock APIs based on an OpenAPI document, allowing you to simulate request/response behavior quickly.
   - **Example Usage:**
     ```bash
     # Install Prism CLI
     npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli

     # Run Prism in mock mode
     prism mock /path/to/telnyx-openapi.yaml
     ```
   - Prism supports dynamic responses, request validation, and proxying to real endpoints if needed.

2. **[API Dog](https://apidog.io/)**
   - API Dog can load your OpenAPI spec and create mock endpoints that reflect the defined paths and schemas.
   - Offers a web-based interface to explore, configure, and test responses.

3. **[Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/)**
   - Primarily known as a web-based API client (similar to Postman), Hoppscotch also supports importing OpenAPI specs.
   - You can mock or quickly test your endpoints to verify correctness and response structure.

## How to Use the Official Telnyx OpenAPI Specification

1. **Obtain the Spec**
   - You can download the official Telnyx OpenAPI YAML or JSON specification from the [Telnyx Developer Documentation](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/overview).

2. **Load It into Your Tool of Choice**
   - Most tools listed above (Prism, API Dog, Hoppscotch) allow you to import your OpenAPI spec either via a file or a URL.

3. **Configure and Start Mocking**
   - Once loaded, each tool provides different configurations to tailor response status codes, payload data, request validation, and more.
   - Consult each tool’s documentation for advanced configurations like dynamic mocking, route overrides, or environment variables.


# telnyx-mock [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/team-telnyx/telnyx-mock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/team-telnyx/telnyx-mock)

telnyx-mock is a mock HTTP server that responds like the real Telnyx API. It
can be used instead of Telnyx's test mode to make test suites integrating with
Telnyx faster and less brittle. It's powered by [the Telnyx OpenAPI
specification][openapi], which is generated from within Telnyx's API.

## Current state of development

telnyx-mock is able to generate an approximately correct API response for any
endpoint, but the logic for doing so is still quite naive. It supports the
following features:

* It has a catalog of every API URL and their signatures. It responds on URLs
  that exist with a resource that it returns and 404s on URLs that don't exist.
* JSON Schema is used to check the validity of the parameters of incoming
  requests. Validation is comprehensive, but far from exhaustive, so don't
  expect the full barrage of checks of the live API.
* Responses are generated based off resource fixtures. They're also generated
  from within Telnyx's API, and similar to the sample data available in
  Telnyx's [API reference][apiref].
* It reflects the values of valid input parameters into responses where the
  naming and type are the same. So if a messaging profile is created with `name=foo`, a
  messaging profile will be returned with `"name": "foo"`.
* It will respond over HTTP or over HTTPS. HTTP/2 over HTTPS is available if
  the client supports it.

Limitations:

* It's currently stateless. Data created with `POST` of `PATCH` calls won't be stored so
  that the same information is available later.
* For polymorphic endpoints, only a single resource type is ever returned. There's no way to
  specify which one that is.
* It's locked to the latest version of Telnyx's API and doesn't support old
  versions.
* Testing for specific responses and error is currently not supported.
  It will return a success response instead of the desired error response.

## Installation

### Binary Release

You can download [a precompiled release][releases] for your platform (64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux) and execute it. With no options, it will start an HTTP server on port 12111.

### Homebrew

Get it from Homebrew:

``` sh
brew install team-telnyx/telnyx-mock/telnyx-mock

# start a telnyx-mock service at login
brew services start telnyx-mock

# upgrade if you already have it
brew upgrade telnyx-mock
```

The Homebrew service listens on port `12111` for HTTP and `12112` for HTTPS and
HTTP/2.

### From Source (built in Docker)

``` sh
# build
docker build . -t telnyx-mock
# run
docker run -p 12111-12112:12111-12112 telnyx-mock
```

The default Docker `ENTRYPOINT` listens on port `12111` for HTTP and `12112`
for HTTPS and HTTP/2.

### From Source

If you have Go installed, you can build the basic binary with:

``` sh
go get -u github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-mock
```

With no arguments, telnyx-mock will listen with HTTP on its default port of
`12111` and HTTPS on `12112`:

``` sh
telnyx-mock
```

Ports can be specified explicitly with:

``` sh
telnyx-mock -http-port 12111 -https-port 12112
```

(Leave either `-http-port` or `-https-port` out to activate telnyx-mock on only
one protocol.)

Have telnyx-mock select a port automatically by passing `0`:

``` sh
telnyx-mock -http-port 0
```

It can also listen via Unix socket:

``` sh
telnyx-mock -http-unix /tmp/telnyx-mock.sock -https-unix /tmp/telnyx-mock-secure.sock
```

## Usage

### Sample request

After you've started telnyx-mock, you can try a sample request against it:

``` sh
curl -i http://localhost:12111/v2/messaging_profiles -H "Authorization: Bearer
KEYSUPERSECRET"
```

---

## Development

### Testing

Run the test suite:

``` sh
go test ./...
```

### Binary data & updating OpenAPI

The project uses [go-bindata] to bundle OpenAPI and fixture data into
`bindata.go` so that it's automatically included with built executables.

You can retrieve the latest OpenAPI spec from
https://api.telnyx.com/v2/mission_control_docs

Pretty format the json and overwrite the `spec3.json` file in
`openapi/openapi/`

Rebuild it with:

``` sh
# Make sure you have the go-bindata executable (it's not vendored into this
# repository).
go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...

# Generates `bindata.go`, packing the spec as a string into a `.go`-file.
go generate
```

## Releasing

Release builds are generated with [goreleaser]. Make sure you have the software
and a GitHub token set at `~/.config/goreleaser/github_token` (brief docs [here](https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-mock/blob/0af23956/.goreleaser.yml#L13-L18) about it). Sorry about configuring it in the file; I (Nick) has issues where goreleaser seemed to ignore `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment...

``` sh
go get -u github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...
```

Commit changes and tag `HEAD`:

``` sh
git pull origin --tags
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin --tags
```

Then run goreleaser and you're done! Check [releases] (it also pushes to [the
Homebrew tap][homebrew-telnyx-mock]).

``` sh
goreleaser --rm-dist
```
